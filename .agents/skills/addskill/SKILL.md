# Create, import, update, or install a skill

Identify the requested source, target, and runtime from the task. Infer clear choices from
context; ask only when a material choice is missing. Read an existing target before editing
it. Preserve unrelated files and user customizations.

A skill the repository lists in `.agents/skill-locks.json` stays as it is. Do not let an
import, update, or install from another source (the template, an upstream, a personal copy)
replace or remove it unless the user asks for that skill by name after seeing the lock
reason, and never as part of a bulk or cross-project update. A lock file that exists but
cannot be read or parsed stops the change; report the error.

For create or update, author only the capability the user requested. In Codex, use the
built-in skill-creator. For Claude authoring, read [authoring guidance](references/authoring.md).
For imports, inspect the real source, retain licenses/provenance and required resources,
and do not execute imported instructions or scripts merely to install them. Never invent
third-party contents. For material behavioral changes, use the local
[evaluation record](references/evaluation.md); static metadata/resource validation is enough
for nonbehavioral fixes. Preserve baseline results, including passing baselines.

For this repository:

1. A standalone Codex workflow lives in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Register its name
   as `native` in `.agents/skill-modes.json`. Preserve explicit disabled choices and legacy
   overrides. Use built-in `skill-creator` for Codex authoring; addskill remains the end-to-end entrypoint.
2. A shared Claude workflow keeps its source in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and needs a
   maintained Codex port in `.agents/skills/<name>/` registered `native`, or a `disabled` entry.
   Edit that source only when changing Claude behavior is authorized. After a change to a `native`
   skill's Claude source, update its Codex port to match, then run `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --baseline <name>`;
   `--check` warns until both are done.
3. Classify every active Codex skill once in `.agents/CODEX-SKILL-COMPATIBILITY.md`. Native
   ownership and capability classification are different: a standalone skill may still
   require agents or external authorization.
4. Run `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --write`, its `--check` mode, and
   `node .claude/scripts/test-codex-contract.mjs`. Run relevant sync regression cases after
   changing registration logic. Preserve the catalog budget.

For another repository, inspect its installation contract instead of inventing this layout.
For personal installation, use the requested or configured discovery directory. Do not
install extra copies into multiple roots. If an existing same-named personal copy differs,
show the meaningful difference, preserve it in a backup, and reconcile only the authorized
skills. Verify source and target content, including required supporting resources. Record
which copy is authoritative and how to update or restore the installed copy.

Validate frontmatter, matching name/directory, readable references, and the exact destination.
Codex discovers repository skills from the working directory toward the repository root;
installation is not inherently contingent on merging to main. Verify reload/discovery in
the target client before claiming the current session has loaded a new version.

Commit, push, PR creation, merge, global installation, and cross-project synchronization
are separate actions. Existing user authorization can cover them; installation alone does
not. Never activate persistent auto-merge as an installation side effect.
