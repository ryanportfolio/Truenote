# Bring the current folder up to full firmware

`$adopt-repo` pulls an external repo into a new mirror. This skill works in place: the folder you are in already holds the user's work (a plain folder, a git repo, or a project with an older or partial firmware copy). It adds every missing firmware piece, merges partial ones, and leaves the user's content alone.

The firmware serves both runtimes: Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`, Codex reads `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/`. Install both sides; never run `.claude/hooks/` scripts from Codex (`bash -n` below only parses them).

Template: `ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware`, default branch `main`. Read it from GitHub; never from a local checkout, which may be stale.

## Scope

The template's `.agents/template-manifest.json` defines the firmware layer: `projectPaths` is what a project gets (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.mcp.json`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `docs/codex-skills.md`, `scripts/lib/` at the time of writing), and `templateOnly` is what stays in the template (README, GUIDE, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, `bootstrap/`, `docs/specs/` and the other showcase and design files). `detect.mjs` reads both, so the scope follows the template. Its `skills` block holds the groups, the required skills, which skills need which (`dependencies`) and the `minimal` preset.

Out of scope unless the user asks: everything in `templateOnly`. Never touch `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/worktrees/`, or app code, manifests, and build config.

## Preflight (stop conditions)

1. Target is the session working directory unless the user named another. Stop if it is a drive root, the home directory, or `~/.claude`.
2. Stop if `origin` is the template itself (`ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware` or `claude-starter`); that is template maintenance, not a project. `detect.mjs` exits with code 3 in that case, so a script can gate on it.
3. If the folder sits inside a larger git repo (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` differs from the folder), confirm the user wants firmware at this subfolder rather than the repo root.
4. Non-git folder: offer `git init` first so every change is reviewable and reversible. Proceed without git only if the user declines; backups below still apply.
5. Dirty git tree: fine, but touch only firmware-layer paths, and name any dirty firmware file in the preview so its uncommitted edits are treated as user content.

## Step 1: fetch the template

Clone to a short path outside the target (Windows loses files past 260 characters with `core.longpaths` off; a silent loss is easy to miss):

```
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware <short-scratch>/hf
```

`--filter=blob:none` keeps full history without blobs, which the detector uses to spot stale-but-unedited template copies. Compare `git ls-files | wc -l` in the clone with `gh api repos/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware/git/trees/main?recursive=1 --jq '[.tree[]|select(.type=="blob")]|length'`.

## Step 2: detect (read-only)

```
node <this-skill-dir>/scripts/detect.mjs --target <folder> --template <short-scratch>/hf
```

`<this-skill-dir>` is this Codex skill's directory (`.agents/skills/apply-firmware` in a repository, or the personal install). Add `--json` for machine-readable output. It stops with exit code 2 when the template manifest is unreadable, has a `version` other than 1, or has a top-level key it does not know; the template is then newer than this skill, so update the skill from the template before going on. It classifies every firmware-layer file:

| Class | Meaning | Default action |
|---|---|---|
| ADD | Absent locally | Copy from template |
| UPDATE-STALE | Byte-identical to an older template version on `main` (unmerged branches do not count), so the user never edited it | Refresh to current template |
| MERGE | Kernel sections, JSON keys, ignore lines | Additive merge (rules below) |
| CONFLICT | Differs from every template version: the user edited it | Ask per file |
| OK | Identical, or existing `.claude/reference/*` project knowledge | Nothing |
| RETIRED | Unedited copy of a file the template once shipped and has since deleted (for example `.agents/skill-capabilities.json` and its checker), or of a template leftover | Offer removal; keep on no |
| SKIPPED | Skill the project listed in `.agents/removed-skills.json` (required skills excepted) | Do not re-add |
| PROJECT-ONLY | Local firmware-layer file the template lacks (custom skill, extra reference) | Keep |

Skill folders are summarized as `n/total files`, so a partial skill shows up as partial.

A template leftover is a folder under `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` with no `SKILL.md`, no `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and no `.agents/skill-modes.json` entry: files a retired skill left behind, such as `writing-skills`. Leftovers are never added; detect names the ones the template still carries on one `template leftovers ignored` line, and an edited project copy counts as PROJECT-ONLY. Every other `.agents/skills/` file is classified like any other file; the template ships no generated adapters.

Links in the firmware layer are listed under SYMLINKS and never followed; a copy through one can land outside the folder, so decide each by hand. A shallow template clone gets a WARNING line: stale detection then sees only part of the history, so re-clone as in Step 1.

Skill dependencies: detect lists DEPENDENCY GAPS, computed over the skills the project will have (present, plus ADD, minus SKIPPED): each `skills.dependencies` need missing from that set, marked when the project recorded it as removed, and each `skills.required` skill the project recorded as removed (it is kept or added anyway, so the record needs fixing). Say so in the preview. Adding the dependency is the default; leaving it out means the dependent skill cannot run.

## Step 3: preview and ask

Show one grouped preview before writing anything: additions (counts plus skill names), stale refreshes, each MERGE with its concrete additions, each CONFLICT with a short diff summary read from the actual files, anything skipped, and every dependency gap. Ask directly, as a numbered list, for:

- each CONFLICT: keep mine (default), take template, or hand-merge;
- each kernel section present in both but differing: keep mine (default) or show the template text so the user can adopt parts;
- any JSON scalar conflict (for example a different `outputStyle`): keep mine by default.

ADD, UPDATE-STALE, and additive MERGE items apply on one approval of the preview. Nothing the user edited is replaced without an explicit per-item yes.

## Step 4: apply

Before replacing or rewriting any existing file, copy it to `.tmp/apply-firmware-backup-<timestamp>/<same path>` and make sure `.tmp/` is gitignored.

- **ADD / UPDATE-STALE**: copy from the clone, preserving path. Copy whole skill folders including `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, and license files.
- **CLAUDE.md**: missing file gets the template kernel. Existing file: append missing `##` sections in template order, keep every project section and every configured FILL IN answer, never rewrite a section the user changed without approval. Missing rows in the reference-library table get added.
- **AGENTS.md**: same section merge; it owns Codex runtime safety, so missing sections matter.
- **`.claude/settings.json`**: deep merge. Add missing keys, union arrays (`permissions.allow`, `permissions.deny`), keep project hooks and add template hooks whose `command` is absent (detect lists them as hook additions, by command). Keep the project value on scalar conflicts unless approved.
- **`.mcp.json`**: add missing `mcpServers` entries; a same-name server with a different config is a CONFLICT.
- **`.agents/skill-modes.json`**: add missing entries; keep project entries, including deliberate `disabled` choices. Leave out entries for SKIPPED skills; detect already drops them from the keys to add.
- **`.agents/removed-skills.json`**: the project's record; keep it as is. Copy the template's empty record only when the file is missing.
- **RETIRED**: delete only the files the user approved; back them up first like any replaced file.
- **`.gitignore` / `.gitattributes`**: append missing lines under a `# Harness` comment; never reorder or drop existing lines.
- **`.claude/reference/*`**: add missing skeleton files only. Existing files are project knowledge.
- **Codex skills**: after skills and registries are in place, run `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --write` (it generates nothing; it deletes old generated adapters), then `--check`, `node .claude/scripts/test-codex-contract.mjs`, and `node .claude/scripts/removed-skills.mjs` (warns on a missing skill not recorded as removed, and on a skill whose dependency is missing). Never add a generated adapter.

## Step 5: configure

If the kernel has FILL IN markers after merging, or the project has no `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, run `$init-project`: it fills the markers from the detected stack, applies the skill profile and prose default, writes project CI with `.claude/scripts/write-ci-workflow.mjs`, and wires the `starter` remote. Pass it this folder's facts rather than re-asking. Adding a `starter` remote needs the user's yes; keep an existing one. Once the remote exists, later updates go through `$sync-starter` instead of this skill.

## Step 6: verify and report

Rerun `detect.mjs`. Expected result: ADD and UPDATE-STALE are empty; MERGE lists only items the user chose to keep; CONFLICT and RETIRED list only declined items. Validate every JSON file parses, `bash -n .claude/hooks/*.sh`, and that the skill folder names match their frontmatter `name`.

Report: files added, refreshed, merged (with the keys and sections), conflicts kept or replaced, backup path, validation output, remaining FILL IN markers, and that new skills and settings load only in a new session: a new Codex session discovers the added `.agents/skills/`, and Claude Code needs a restart.

## Hard rules

- Never overwrite user-edited content without a per-item yes; back up anything replaced.
- Never commit, push, create remotes, or install dependencies as part of applying; those need their own request.
- Never modify app code, manifests, or build config.
- Never bulk-copy `.claude/` over the folder; that clobbers settings and project knowledge.
- Delete the scratch template clone when done.
