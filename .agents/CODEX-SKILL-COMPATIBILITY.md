# Codex Skill Compatibility

`.claude/skills/` remains Claude's source. An adapter exposes a workflow; it does not prove every runtime capability exists.

- **Native**: direct mapping.
- **Adapted**: Codex paths, approvals, or UI substitutions.
- **Capability-gated**: requires a currently exposed tool.
- **Claude-only**: no faithful Codex implementation.
- **Dangerous**: explicit authorization required for Git, deploy, migration, publish, or persistent side effects.

| Status | Skills |
|---|---|
| Native | `applying-best-practices`, `brainstorming`, `caveman`, `conflict`, `enhance-prompt`, `executing-plans`, `handoff-audit`, `humanizer`, `learning`, `recall`, `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, `writing-plans` |
| Adapted | `addskill`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `impeccable`, `init-project`, `lab`, `optimize-context`, `sync-starter`, `using-git-worktrees`, `using-superpowers`, `writing-skills` |
| Capability-gated | `advocate`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `impartial-review`, `subagent-driven-development`, `why` |
| Dangerous | `merge`, `pr`, `safe-ship` |
| Claude-only | None in the starter source set. |

`advocate`, `impartial-review`, and `why` require fresh independent context; do not replace them with self-review and call it equivalent. `merge` becomes session-wide only after explicit `$merge` or an unambiguous auto-merge request. Current system, developer, sandbox, approval, and user instructions win. Resolve canonical resources from `.claude/skills/<name>/` and never claim a gated workflow ran unless its tools were used.
