# sync-starter — two-way sync with the claude-starter template

Spawned projects freeze the template at spawn date; the template keeps improving. This skill closes the gap in both directions. Template repo: `ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware` (formerly `claude-starter`; the old URL redirects, but use the new one).

## Direction A: Pull template improvements into this project

### Step 1: Wire the remote (once)

```
git remote get-url starter || git remote add starter https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware.git
git fetch starter
```

### Step 2: Diff the shared surface

Only these paths are sync candidates:

```
git diff --stat HEAD starter/main -- AGENTS.md .agents/CODEX-SKILL-COMPATIBILITY.md .agents/skill-modes.json .agents/skill-sources.json .agents/skills .claude/skills .claude/hooks .claude/scripts .claude/output-styles .claude/settings.json
```

**Diverged-by-design — NEVER bulk-pull these:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — project-configured (FILL IN sections replaced). If the template's kernel changed, read the template version (`git show starter/main:CLAUDE.md`), and hand-merge the relevant rule into the project copy.
- `.claude/reference/*` — project knowledge. Template only ships skeletons.

### Step 3: Present and pick

Group the diff for the user: **new skills** / **changed skills** / **Codex boundary+compatibility** / **hooks+scripts+settings**, one line each on what changed (read the actual diff, don't guess from filenames). Ask which to take (plain chat, numbered).

### Step 4: Apply selectively

Compare maintained native bodies and every referenced resource, together with `.agents/skill-modes.json` and `.agents/skill-sources.json`. Reconcile each selected ownership change with its corresponding files. Preserve project customizations and deliberate disables; merge customized native files and registry entries instead of checking out whole directories. Sync never writes Codex skills; every port is maintained by hand. Take a skill's upstream `.agents/skill-sources.json` hash only with its unchanged upstream Claude skill; for a customized Claude skill registered `native`, update its Codex port and run `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --baseline <name>`. A `disabled` skill has no port and no recorded hash. Inspect the registry first to distinguish ownership. Apply already-approved selections without another permission round.

```
git checkout starter/main -- <picked-paths>
```

Handle selected retirements explicitly before running the sync check: checkout does not remove
files absent upstream. For this migration, remove `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md`
and `.claude/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md`, plus any retired counterpart entrypoint
left by an earlier partial sync. First inspect and back up local customizations;
move useful behavior into the replacement skill or preserve it outside discovery.
Keep supporting resources and licenses. Drop the `unslop` ownership entry; an
inherited `writing-skills: disabled` entry may remain inert. Confirm no retired
name retains a SKILL.md in either root before running the sync check.

For `settings.json`: merge, don't overwrite — the project may have its own permission additions. Read both, union the `allow` lists, keep project-specific hooks.

After any skill, sync script, compatibility matrix, or `skillOverrides` change, run
`node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --write` (it deletes leftover generated
adapters and fails on unregistered skills or Claude skills that drifted from their port),
and `node .claude/scripts/test-codex-contract.mjs`. Stage
`.agents/skill-sources.json` and any deleted adapter files along with the selected pulled paths.

### Step 5: Ship

Only when shipping is authorized, branch, stage exactly the selected pulled paths plus `.agents/skill-sources.json` and deleted adapter paths, commit (`Sync from claude-starter: <what>`), push, and open a PR, per the project's git rule.

## Direction B: Push a generic improvement back to the template

When the user authorized propagation of a generic skill fix / new skill / hook improvement made in THIS project:

1. **Genericize first.** Strip project-specific names, paths, URLs, stack assumptions — the same scrub discipline the template was built with. If it can't be genericized, it doesn't go back.
2. **Get the change to the template repo:**
   - If this machine has the template checked out locally (e.g. `~/code/Harness-Firmware`), apply the change there directly.
   - Otherwise clone it to scratch: `git clone https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware .tmp/Harness-Firmware`, apply, push from there.
3. Commit to the template on a branch, push, open the PR (or follow an explicit user-approved branch strategy). **Use a PR for `bootstrap/`, `.claude/hooks/`, or `settings.json` by default**: those are the spawn-critical surface, and the `validate-template` Action's `generator-smoke` job exists because spawn time is the worst possible moment for them to fail. Skill or doc prose is a different blast radius; a broken `.ps1` is not.
   - CI gates **both** `push` and `pull_request`, so direct-to-main is still checked — just after the change is live to everyone spawning a project, which is why PR is the default.
   - That dual trigger means a PR shows two check runs and sits at `mergeStateStatus: UNSTABLE` until the second finishes. Wait for it (`gh run watch <id> --exit-status`); don't merge on the first green.
   - The template allows squash only: `gh pr merge <n> --squash`.
   - If the change touched a skill registered `native`, update its Codex version in `.agents/skills/` to match, run `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --baseline <name>`, then `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --check`. A `disabled` (Claude-only) skill takes no port or baseline; run `--check` only. CI runs the same check and fails when a Claude skill changed without a re-baseline, or when a skill has no `native` or `disabled` entry.
4. **Bump the plugin version** when the change touches the shared surface (`.claude/skills`, `.claude/hooks`, `.claude/output-styles`, `.claude/settings.json`): edit `version` in the template's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — patch for fixes, minor for new skills. Plugin installs only receive updates when this number changes; spawned projects get changes via Direction A regardless.
5. Mention that other spawned projects pick it up via Direction A.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't `git checkout starter/main -- .claude` wholesale — it clobbers diverged-by-design files.
- Don't overwrite `settings.json` — union the permission lists.
- Don't push project-flavored content back to the template — genericize or leave it.
- Don't treat a CLAUDE.md diff as pullable — kernel changes are always a hand-merge.
- Don't ship a generated `.agents/skills/` adapter. Write a native port under
  `.agents/skills/<name>/` and register it `native`, or register the skill `disabled`.
- Don't sync on every session. This is occasional maintenance, user-triggered.
